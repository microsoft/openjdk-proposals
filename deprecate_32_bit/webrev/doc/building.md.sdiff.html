 111 ## Build Hardware Requirements
 112 
 113 The JDK is a massive project, and require machines ranging from decent to
 114 powerful to be able to build in a reasonable amount of time, or to be able to
 115 complete a build at all.
 116 
 117 We *strongly* recommend usage of an SSD disk for the build, since disk speed is
 118 one of the limiting factors for build performance.
 119 
 120 ### Building on x86
 121 
 122 At a minimum, a machine with 2-4 cores is advisable, as well as 2-4 GB of RAM.
 123 (The more cores to use, the more memory you need.) At least 6 GB of free disk
 124 space is required.
 125 
 126 Even for 32-bit builds, it is recommended to use a 64-bit build machine, and
 127 instead create a 32-bit target using `--with-target-bits=32`.
 128 


 129 ### Building on aarch64
 130 
 131 At a minimum, a machine with 8 cores is advisable, as well as 8 GB of RAM.
 132 (The more cores to use, the more memory you need.) At least 6 GB of free disk
 133 space is required.
 134 
 135 If you do not have access to sufficiently powerful hardware, it is also
 136 possible to use [cross-compiling](#cross-compiling).
 137 
 138 #### Branch Protection
 139 
 140 In order to use Branch Protection features in the VM, `--enable-branch-protection`
 141 must be used. This option requires C++ compiler support (GCC 9.1.0+ or Clang
 142 10+). The resulting build can be run on both machines with and without support
 143 for branch protection in hardware. Branch Protection is only supported for
 144 Linux targets.
 145 
 146 ### Building on 32-bit arm
 147 
 148 This is not recommended. Instead, see the section on [Cross-compiling](

 182 Windows XP is not a supported platform, but all newer Windows should be able to
 183 build the JDK.
 184 
 185 On Windows, it is important that you pay attention to the instructions in the
 186 [Special Considerations](#special-considerations).
 187 
 188 Windows is the only non-POSIX OS supported by the JDK, and as such, requires
 189 some extra care. A POSIX support layer is required to build on Windows.
 190 Currently, the only supported such layers are Cygwin, Windows Subsystem for
 191 Linux (WSL), and MSYS2. (MSYS is no longer supported due to an outdated bash;
 192 While OpenJDK can be built with MSYS2, support for it is still experimental, so
 193 build failures and unusual errors are not uncommon.)
 194 
 195 Internally in the build system, all paths are represented as Unix-style paths,
 196 e.g. `/cygdrive/c/git/jdk/Makefile` rather than `C:\git\jdk\Makefile`. This
 197 rule also applies to input to the build system, e.g. in arguments to
 198 `configure`. So, use `--with-msvcr-dll=/cygdrive/c/msvcr100.dll` rather than
 199 `--with-msvcr-dll=c:\msvcr100.dll`. For details on this conversion, see the section
 200 on [Fixpath](#fixpath).
 201 


 202 #### Cygwin
 203 
 204 A functioning [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) environment is required for
 205 building the JDK on Windows. If you have a 64-bit OS, we strongly recommend
 206 using the 64-bit version of Cygwin.
 207 
 208 **Note:** Cygwin has a model of continuously updating all packages without any
 209 easy way to install or revert to a specific version of a package. This means
 210 that whenever you add or update a package in Cygwin, you might (inadvertently)
 211 update tools that are used by the JDK build process, and that can cause
 212 unexpected build problems.
 213 
 214 The JDK requires GNU Make 4.0 or greater in Cygwin. This is usually not a
 215 problem, since Cygwin currently only distributes GNU Make at a version above
 216 4.0.
 217 
 218 Apart from the basic Cygwin installation, the following packages must also be
 219 installed:
 220 
 221   * `autoconf`
