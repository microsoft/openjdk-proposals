# Ergonomics Profiles

## Summary

Introduce a new JVM feature for Ergonomics Profiles, with a `shared` profile for the existing heuristics and a `dedicated` option for when the JVM is running on systems with dedicated resources for the one JVM process.

## Goals

1. Introduce the concept of ergonomics profiles.
1. Introduce a new flag to select an ergonomic profile.
1. Define existing heuristics and ergonomics as `shared`.
1. Introduce a `dedicated` profile designed for systems where the JVM is the dominant process using resources, e.g., in a canonical container deployment scenario.
1. Automatically select the `dedicated` profile when the JVM believes the system has dedicated resources to it.

## Non-Goals

This JEP does not aim to ensure that applications' performance will be improved when running under the `dedicated` profile.

## Success Metrics

No specific success metrics are needed.

## Motivation

The design of default JVM ergonomics was for environments where the JVM had to share resources with other processes (e.g., a data store) running on a shared environment, such as a bare metal server or a large virtual machine.

A study in 2023 by New Relic, an APM vendor with access to millions of JVMs in production, identified that more than 70% of their customers' JVMs are running inside environments with resources dedicated to the JVM (i.e., in containers) instead of being shared. Many JVMs with dedicated resources ran without explicit JVM tuning flags. Therefore the JVM was running with default ergonomics traditionally aimed at shared environments. With the existing 'shared' default ergonomics, the JVM does not fully utilize the memory available in such dedicated environments, and the system wastes resources. Users then resort to horizontal scaling to address performance issues before addressing resource planning for the JVM (and its tuning). This premature move to horizontal scaling, in turn, leads to even more resource waste, both in terms of computing resources and engineering resources (hours spent tuning/scaling).

By maximizing resource consumption in environments with dedicated resources for the JVM process, the JVM has more opportunities to improve throughput and latency, or at the least, meet the resource consumption (footprint) expected by the user.

Currently, the default ergonomics are:

### Memory Allocation

The default maximum heap size of the JVM varies from 50% to 25%, depending on how much memory is available in the environment. The table below describes the current heuristics of OpenJDK 21:

**_Max heap size_**

| Available memory | Default |
|------------------|---------|
| < 256 MB         | 50%     |
| 256 - 512 MB     | ~126 MB |
| >= 512 MB        | 25%     |

The initial heap size also varies. The table below describes the current heuristics of OpenJDK 21:

**_Initial heap size_**

| Available memory | Default      |
|------------------|--------------|
| <= 512 MB        | 8 MB         |
| >= 512 MB        | 1.5625%-1.7% |

**_Min heap size_**

| Available memory | Default      |
|------------------|--------------|
| 64 MB â€“ 8192 MB  | 8 MB         |

It is possible to observe that these amounts don't adequately map to the intended resource plan of dedicated environments. The user may have already considered allocating, e.g., 4GB of memory to the environment and expect the JVM to use nearly 4GB of memory. In this example, the JVM will instead use 1GB of memory by default (25%), and the user will have to manually tune the JVM to allocate the expected amount of memory for the heap.

Further on, it is likely that the JVM can reclaim heap memory later than it does in shared environments, as the JVM is the only process running on the system. Knowing it is the only process, this means that the JVM may set the initial heap size closer to the maximum heap size while having a suitable minimum heap size for other memory pools consumption (e.g., native memory).

### Garbage Collector

The default garbage collector selection happens only among two: Serial GC and G1 GC, based on the number of active processors seen by the JVM, and the amount of available memory, with a slightly different way of defining the GC thread pool:

**_GC selection_**

| Memory     | Processors | GC selected |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| \>=1792 MB | \>1        | G1          |
| Otherwise  |            | Serial      |

Which GC is used by the application will impact the amount of native memory consumed by the JVM, and the throughput and latency of the application.

_**GC threads**_

We document the current implementation detail of GC threads ergonomically configured by the JVM for reference.

| GC        | \# of CPUs | ConcGCThreads                   | ParallelGCThreads      |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Serial GC | any        | 0                               | 0                      |
| G1 GC     | 1-8        | max((ParallelGCThreads+2)/4, 1) | ceil(#CPUs)            |
| G1 GC     | \>8        | max((ParallelGCThreads+2)/4, 1) | 8 + (#CPUs-8) \* (5/8) |

## Description

We propose adding the concept of Ergonomics Profiles while naming the existing default ergonomics as `shared` and adding a second profile called `dedicated` for when the JVM is to run under environments with dedicated resources.

**_Selecting a profile_**

To select a profile, this JEP proposes a new flag:

```sh
-XX:ErgonomicsProfile=<shared|dedicated>
```

Users may also select a profile by setting this flag in the environment variable `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`.

**_Default profile selection_**

The `shared` ergonomics profile will be selected by default unless the JVM believes it is running in a dedicated environment (e.g., containers). The JVM will activate the `dedicated` profile in this case.

**_Shared profile_**

The `shared` profile is what the HotSpot JVM does today regarding default ergonomics.

**_Dedicated profile_**

 Assuming the environment is dedicated to the JVM, the `dedicated` profile will contain different heuristics to maximize resource consumption. This profile will maximize heap size allocation, optimize garbage collector selection with a more extensive set of options and considerations, and more aggressively estimate native memory expectations.

The table below describes what the `dedicated` profile will set for the JVM:

* GC selection: see below
* Default maximum heap size: see below
* Default initial heap size: 50%
* Default minimum heap size: 25%
* GC threads: unchanged

**_Selecting a garbage collector in dedicated profile_**

| Memory     | Processors | GC selected |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| \>=16 GB   | \>1        | ZGC         |
| \>2048 MB  | \>1        | G1          |
| \<=2048 MB | \>1        | ParallelGC  |
| Any        | 1          | Serial      |

**_Default maximum heap size_**

We progressively grow the heap size percentage based on the available memory to reduce waste on memory reserved for off-heap (native) operations. This heap size percentage growth is an estimate that native memory usage is done at occasional moments throughout the operation of the JVM for most applications. Otherwise, if the percentage were to be the same, progressive waste would exist. Users are still encouraged to monitor and observe memory consumption and adjust heap size allocation accordingly.

| Memory      | Heap size |
| ----------- | --------- |
| >= 16  GB   | 90%       |
| >= 6   GB   | 85%       |
| >= 4   GB   | 80%       |
| >= 0.5 GB   | 75%       |
| <  0.5 GB   | 50%       |

**_API to identify selected profile_**

An application can obtain the profile selection programmatically by reading the property `java.vm.ergonomics.profile`:

```java
var ergonomicsProfile = System.getProperty("java.vm.ergonomics.profile");
```

The profile selection may also be obtained programmatically through JMX by the inclusion of the following method in `java.management.RuntimeMXBean`:

```java
String getJvmErgonomicsProfile()
```

The value may also be obtained through the `MBeanServerConnection.getAttribute` method, with the name `JvmErgonomicsProfile`, to allow the back-porting of this feature to older versions of OpenJDK:

```java
MBeanServerConnection mBeanServerConnection = ...

var objectName = new ObjectName(ManagementFactory.RUNTIME_MXBEAN_NAME);
var ergonomicsProfile = mBeanServerConnection.getAttribute(objectName, "JvmErgonomicsProfile");
```

## Alternatives

Currently, the only alternative to this proposal is manually tuning the JVM. This exercise is often complex, challenging, and time-consuming for Java developers.

## Testing

// What kinds of test development and execution will be required in order
// to validate this enhancement beyond the usual mandatory unit tests?
// Be sure to list any special platform or hardware requirements.

We will provide tests to ensure the correct profile selection on expected environments:

 1. Execution in a VM shall select the `shared` profile
 1. Execution in a container shall select the `dedicated` profile

We will provide other tests to validate the heuristics of the `dedicated` profile.
