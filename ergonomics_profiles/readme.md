# Ergonomics Profiles

Ongoing PR: https://github.com/microsoft/openjdk-jdk/pull/9

## Summary

Introduce a new JVM feature named Ergonomics Profiles, with a `shared` profile for the existing heuristics and a `dedicated` option for when the JVM is running on systems with dedicated resources for the one JVM process.

## Goals

1. Introduce the concept of ergonomics profiles.
1. Introduce a new flag to select an ergonomic profile.
1. Define existing heuristics and ergonomics as `shared`.
1. Introduce a `dedicated` profile designed for systems where the JVM is the dominant process using the allocated resources, e.g., in a canonical container deployment scenario. The purpose of this profile is to utilize most of the resources allocated to the machine/container.
1. Introduce an `auto` mode to automatically select between `dedicated` and `shared`.
1. Expose the selected Garbage Collector's name and the selected Ergonomics Profile through RuntimeMXBean.

## Non-Goals

This JEP does not aim to increase performance of applications when running under the `dedicated` profile.

## Success Metrics

No specific success metrics are needed.

## Motivation

The original design of default JVM ergonomics and heuristics was aimed at traditional bare metal servers or large virtual machine environments where the JVM shares resources with other processes (e.g., a data store). Today, more than half of Cloud based JVM workloads are running in dedicated environments such as containers.

A study in 2023 by New Relic, an APM vendor with access to millions of JVMs in production, identified that more than 70% of their customers' JVMs were running inside dedicated environments. Many of these JVMs were running without explicit JVM tuning flags. Therefore the JVM was running with default ergonomics traditionally aimed at shared environments. Under this condition, the JVM does not utilize most of the memory available. With underuse of available resources, application developers and operators tend to apply horizontal scaling to address performance issues. This premature move to horizontal scaling, in turn, leads to more resource waste, both in terms of computing resources and engineering resources.

By increasing JVM's awareness to more resources available in dedicated environments, the JVM will have more opportunities to behave adequately, or at the very least meet the resource consumption (footprint) expected by the user. On the other hand allocating too much resources to the JVM can be dangerous.

Currently, the default ergonomics of the HotSpot JVM are:

### Memory Allocation

The default maximum heap size of the JVM varies from 50% to 25%, depending on how much memory is available in the environment. The table below describes the current heuristics of OpenJDK 21:

**_Max heap size_**

| Available memory | Default |
|------------------|---------|
| < 256 MB         | 50%     |
| 256 - 512 MB     | ~126 MB |
| >= 512 MB        | 25%     |

The initial heap size also varies. The table below describes the current heuristics of OpenJDK 21:

**_Initial heap size_**

| Available memory | Default      |
|------------------|--------------|
| <= 512 MB        | 8 MB         |
| >= 512 MB        | 1.5625%-1.7% |

**_Min heap size_**

| Available memory | Default      |
|------------------|--------------|
| 64 MB â€“ 8192 MB  | 8 MB         |

We can observe that these amounts don't adequately map to the intended resource plan of dedicated environments. The user may have already considered allocating, e.g., 4GB of memory to the environment and expect the JVM to use _nearly_ 4GB of memory. In this example, the JVM will instead use only 1GB of memory by default (25%) for its heap, and the user will have to manually tune the JVM if they want to ensure larger heap.

Furthermore, it is likely that the JVM can reclaim heap memory later than it does in shared environments, as the JVM is the only process running on such environment. Knowing it is the only or primary process, this means that the JVM may set the initial heap size closer to the maximum heap size while having a suitable minimum heap size for other memory pools (e.g., native memory).

### Garbage Collector

The default garbage collector selection happens only among two: Serial GC and G1 GC, based on the number of active processors seen by the JVM, and the amount of available memory, with a slightly different way of defining the GC thread pool:

**_GC selection_**

| Memory     | Processors | GC selected |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| \>=1792 MB | \>1        | G1          |
| Otherwise  |            | Serial      |

Which GC is used by the application will impact the amount of native memory consumed by the JVM, and the throughput and latency of the application.

_**GC threads**_

We document the current implementation detail of GC threads ergonomically configured by the JVM for reference.

| GC        | \# of CPUs | ConcGCThreads                   | ParallelGCThreads      |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Serial GC | any        | 0                               | 0                      |
| G1 GC     | 1-8        | max((ParallelGCThreads+2)/4, 1) | ceil(#CPUs)            |
| G1 GC     | \>8        | max((ParallelGCThreads+2)/4, 1) | 8 + (#CPUs-8) \* (5/8) |

## Description

This JEP proposes adding the concept of Ergonomics Profiles while naming the existing ergonomics as `shared` and adding a second profile named `dedicated` for when the JVM is aimed at environments with dedicated resources, such as, but not limited to, containers.

### Selecting a profile

To select a profile, this JEP proposes a new flag:

```sh
-XX:ErgonomicsProfile=<shared|dedicated|auto>
```

Users may also select a profile by setting this flag in the environment variable `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`. This will be useful for VM templates meant for dedicated JVM-based applications.

### Default profile selection

The `shared` ergonomics profile will be selected by default.

### Auto profile selection

When the the `auto` mode is selected, the JVM will activate the `dedicated` profile in cases it believes the resources are dedicated. This JEP implements support for Linux containers dectection only.

### Shared profile

The `shared` profile represents the heuristics that the HotSpot JVM uses today.

### Dedicated profile

 Assuming the environment is dedicated to the JVM, the `dedicated` profile will contain different heuristics to maximize resource consumption. This profile will maximize heap size allocation, optimize garbage collector selection with a more extensive set of options and considerations, and more aggressively estimate native memory consumption.

The table below describes what the `dedicated` profile will set for the JVM:

* GC selection: see below
* Default maximum heap size: see below
* Default initial heap size: 50%
* Default minimum heap size: 25%
* GC threads: unchanged

#### Selecting a garbage collector in dedicated profile

| Memory     | Processors | GC selected |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Any        | 1          | Serial      |
| \<=2048 MB | \>1        | ParallelGC  |
| \>2048 MB  | \>1        | G1          |
| \>=16 GB   | \>1        | ZGC         |

#### Default maximum heap size
Memory refers to the physical machine excluding swap space on a physical/virtual machine and the cgroup memory limit in the case of a container. 

#### Default maximum heap size

We progressively grow the heap size percentage based on the available memory to reduce waste on memory reserved for off-heap (native) operations. This heap size percentage growth is an estimate that native memory usage is required at occasional moments throughout the operation of the JVM for most applications. Otherwise, if the percentage were to be the same, progressive waste would exist. Users are still encouraged to monitor and observe memory consumption and adjust heap size allocation accordingly.

| Memory      | Heap size |
| ----------- | --------- |
| <  0.5 GB   | 50%       |
| >= 0.5 GB   | 75%       |
| >= 4   GB   | 80%       |
| >= 6   GB   | 85%       |
| >= 16  GB   | 90%       |

### Changes to RuntimeMXBean

An application can obtain the profile selection programmatically by reading the property `java.vm.ergonomics.profile`:

```java
var ergonomicsProfile = System.getProperty("java.vm.ergonomics.profile");
```

The profile selection may also be obtained programmatically through JMX by the inclusion of the following method in `java.management.RuntimeMXBean`:

```java
String getJvmErgonomicsProfile()
```

The name of the garbage collector currently running will also be exposed through the RuntimeMXBean:

```java
String getGCName()
```

## Testing

This JEP introduces a new JTreg test named `TestErgonomicsProfiles` under `test/hotspot/jtreg/gc/ergonomics`. The tests ensure the correct profile selection, as well as the expected GC selection and heap size `MaxRAMPercentage` allocations.

## Risks and Assumptions
Allocating too much memory for the process can cause the container to be killed. The `dedicated` profile, when active, will not override manually tuned settings.
