# Ergonomics Profiles

Ongoing PR: https://github.com/microsoft/openjdk-jdk/pull/9

## Summary

Introduce a new JVM feature named Ergonomics Profiles, with a `shared` profile for the existing heuristics and a `dedicated` option for when the JVM is running on systems with dedicated resources for the one JVM process.

## Goals

Reduce resource waste without requiring manual heap size configuration by:

1. Introducing the concept of ergonomics profiles.
1. Defining existing heuristics as `shared`, and maintaining it as default.
1. Defining a new set of heuristics as `dedicated` designed for systems where the JVM is the dominant process using the reserved resources, e.g., in a container deployment scenario.
1. Defining an `auto` mode to automatically select between `dedicated` and `shared` based on environment characteristics.

## Non-Goals

It is not a goal of this effort to:

 - Increase performance of applications when running under the `dedicated` profile.
 - Change the default ergonomics profile to `dedicated` automatically in dedicated environments i.e. containers.
 - Remove the existing configurability of heap sizes and GC selection flags.

## Success Metrics

The `dedicated` profile, when active, should produce lesser resource waste with no performance regression, for a majority of workloads, compared to traditional heuristics, when running in a dedicated environment. 

## Motivation

The original design of default JVM ergonomics and heuristics was aimed at traditional bare metal servers or large virtual machine environments where the JVM shares resources with other processes (e.g., a data store). Today, more than half of Cloud based JVM workloads are running in dedicated environments such as containers.

A study in 2023 by New Relic, an APM vendor with access to millions of JVMs in production, identified that more than 70% of their customers' JVMs were running inside dedicated environments. Many of these JVMs were running without explicit JVM tuning flags. Therefore the JVM was running with default ergonomics traditionally aimed at shared environments. Under this condition, the JVM does not utilize most of the memory available. With underuse of available resources, application developers and operators tend to apply horizontal scaling to address performance issues. This premature move to horizontal scaling, in turn, leads to more resource waste, both in terms of computing resources and engineering resources.

By increasing JVM's awareness to more resources available in dedicated environments, the JVM will have more opportunities to behave adequately, or at the very least meet the resource consumption (footprint) expected by the user. On the other hand allocating too much resources to the JVM can be dangerous.

## Description

This JEP proposes adding the concept of Ergonomics Profiles. The existing ergonomics will be under the `shared` profile. A second profile named `dedicated` is for when the JVM is aimed at environments with dedicated resources, such as, but not limited to, containers. A third value, `auto`, may be used to let the JVM select the ergonomic profile based on environment characteristics (e.g. it's running inside a container). The default profile will be `shared`.

### Selecting a profile

To set an ergonomic profile, the user may provide the following flag:

```sh
-XX:ErgonomicsProfile=<shared|dedicated|auto>
```

### Default profile

The `shared` ergonomics profile will be selected by default.

### Auto profile selection

When the the `auto` mode is selected, the JVM will activate the `dedicated` profile in cases it believes the resources are dedicated. This JEP proposes support for Linux containers dectection only.

### Shared profile

The `shared` profile represents the heuristics that the HotSpot JVM uses today.

### Dedicated profile

Assuming the environment is dedicated to the JVM, the `dedicated` profile will contain different heuristics to minimize resource waste. This profile will increase heap size allocation compared to `shared`, and expand garbage collector selection to more options and considerations. The table below describes what the `dedicated` profile will set for the JVM:

* GC selection: see below
* Default maximum heap size: see below
* Default initial heap size: 50%
* Default minimum heap size: unchanged
* GC threads: unchanged

#### Selecting a garbage collector in dedicated profile

| Memory     | Processors | GC selected |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Any        | 1          | Serial      |
| \<=2048 MB | \>1        | ParallelGC  |
| \>2048 MB  | \>1        | G1          |
| \>=16 GB   | \>1        | ZGC         |

#### Default initial heap size

The `dedicated` profile will set an `InitialRAMPercentage` at 50%.

#### Default maximum heap size

We progressively grow the heap size percentage based on the available memory to reduce waste on memory reserved for non-heap operations. This heap size percentage growth is an estimate that native memory usage is required at occasional moments throughout the operation of the JVM for most applications. Otherwise, if the percentage were to be the same, progressive waste would still exist.

| Memory      | Heap size |
| ----------- | --------- |
| <  0.5 GB   | 50%       |
| >= 0.5 GB   | 75%       |
| >= 4   GB   | 80%       |
| >= 6   GB   | 85%       |
| >= 16  GB   | 90%       |

### Changes to RuntimeMXBean

An application can obtain the profile selection programmatically by reading the property `java.vm.ergonomics.profile`:

```java
var ergonomicsProfile = System.getProperty("java.vm.ergonomics.profile");
```

The profile selection may also be obtained programmatically through JMX by the inclusion of the following method in `java.management.RuntimeMXBean`:

```java
String getJvmErgonomicsProfile()
```

## Testing

This proposal only affects ergonomiocs when `dedicated` profile is active, by either selecting it directly, or by using `auto`.
This profile will be thoroughly performance tested with a variety of workloads commonly deployed in dedicated environments such as containers, with a variety of memory and CPU settings. 

## Risks and Assumptions
The `dedicated` profile may not be ideal for certain workloads where non-heap memory is required beyond assumed differences between total available memory and heuristics ergonomically selected.
For these workloads, manual tuning will still be required.

## Current Ergonomics

Currently, the default ergonomics of the HotSpot JVM are:

### Memory Allocation

The default maximum heap size of the JVM varies from 50% to 25%, depending on how much memory is available in the environment. The table below describes the current heuristics of OpenJDK 21:

**_Max heap size_**

| Available memory | Default |
|------------------|---------|
| < 256 MB         | 50%     |
| 256 - 512 MB     | ~126 MB |
| >= 512 MB        | 25%     |

The initial heap size also varies. The table below describes the current heuristics of OpenJDK 21:

**_Initial heap size_**

| Available memory | Default      |
|------------------|--------------|
| <= 512 MB        | 8 MB         |
| >= 512 MB        | 1.5625%-1.7% |

**_Min heap size_**

| Available memory | Default      |
|------------------|--------------|
| 64 MB â€“ 8192 MB  | 8 MB         |

We can observe that these amounts don't adequately map to the intended resource plan of dedicated environments. The user may have already considered allocating, e.g., 4GB of memory to the environment and expect the JVM to use _nearly_ 4GB of memory. In this example, the JVM will instead use only 1GB of memory by default (25%) for its heap, and the user will have to manually tune the JVM if they want to ensure larger heap.

Furthermore, it is likely that the JVM can reclaim heap memory later than it does in shared environments, as the JVM is the only process running on such environment. Knowing it is the only or primary process, this means that the JVM may set the initial heap size closer to the maximum heap size while having a suitable minimum heap size for other memory pools (e.g., native memory).

### Garbage Collector

The default garbage collector selection happens only among two: Serial GC and G1 GC, based on the number of active processors seen by the JVM, and the amount of available memory, with a slightly different way of defining the GC thread pool:

**_GC selection_**

| Memory     | Processors | GC selected |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| \>=1792 MB | \>1        | G1          |
| Otherwise  |            | Serial      |

Which GC is used by the application will impact the amount of native memory consumed by the JVM, and the throughput and latency of the application.

_**GC threads**_

We document the current implementation detail of GC threads ergonomically configured by the JVM for reference.

| GC        | \# of CPUs | ConcGCThreads                   | ParallelGCThreads      |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Serial GC | any        | 0                               | 0                      |
| G1 GC     | 1-8        | max((ParallelGCThreads+2)/4, 1) | ceil(#CPUs)            |
| G1 GC     | \>8        | max((ParallelGCThreads+2)/4, 1) | 8 + (#CPUs-8) \* (5/8) |
